			There are many people who I need to thank for this website: people in the internet, content creators, and much more. Here are some of them and why they are so important: <em>RANDALL MUNROE</em>, for inspiring me with his amazing <a href="https://xkcd.com/">website</a>, books, and comics. <em>BILL AHMED</em>, for his fun and imaginative <a href="https://foxtrot.com/">comics</a> that inspires me with ideas.<br>
			A LOT of thanks to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> and the folks at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> for nearly half of the code and support.
